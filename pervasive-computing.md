### General Ideas Taken From Article

- Pervasive computing has allowed for multiple components to communicate with each other through a shared middle ware platform.

- Customized Ambient Assisted Living platforms are customized pervasive systems that require extended evaluation methods, especially feature focused testing methods.

- Some examples of AAL are cognitive orthotics, home emergency detection, etc.

- The users of AAL are very diverse, in which a problem is presented in terms of customizing the system to fit every one person's needs.

- The paper provide a scenario of a person with dementia trying to make a cup of tea. The scenario consist of several steps that require completion before the scenario is complete. Each of the tasks have sensor to observe whether the person with dementia completes the task.

- Each of the sensors for the individual task produce an output to provide assistance to the user. These prompts are often given back to the user in audio form. When the system prompts the user, sensors continue to poll to see if the user has made the appropriate actions to complete the task.

- UniversAAL system provides communications though a bus architecture that follows a common publisher subscriber methodology.
