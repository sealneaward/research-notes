# [Comparative Analysis of Prominent Middleware Platforms in theDomain of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) for an Older Adults with Dementia (OAwD) Scenario](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S187705091630285X/1-s2.0-S187705091630285X-main.pdf?_tid=6ef3923a-ee5e-11e6-b06a-00000aab0f6b&acdnat=1486600183_6f0ebf218cebf08169be0d3c9368eb2a)

### General Ideas Taken From Article

- Pervasive computing has allowed for multiple components to communicate with each other through a shared middle ware platform.

- Customized Ambient Assisted Living platforms are customized pervasive systems that require extended evaluation methods, especially feature focused testing methods.

- Some examples of AAL are cognitive orthotics, home emergency detection, etc.

- The users of AAL are very diverse, in which a problem is presented in terms of customizing the system to fit every one person's needs.

- The paper provide a scenario of a person with dementia trying to make a cup of tea. The scenario consist of several steps that require completion before the scenario is complete. Each of the tasks have sensor to observe whether the person with dementia completes the task.

- Each of the sensors for the individual task produce an output to provide assistance to the user. These prompts are often given back to the user in audio form. When the system prompts the user, sensors continue to poll to see if the user has made the appropriate actions to complete the task.

- UniversAAL system provides communications though a bus architecture that follows a common publisher subscriber methodology.

#[An Ontology for Context-Aware Pervasive Computing Environments](http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/_file_directory_/papers/63.pdf)

### General Ideas Taken From Article

- The paper describes the COBRA ontology, which is a context-broker based system.
- The broker provides knowledge sharing, context reasoning, and privacy protections.

- An important part of pervasive development is having systems integrate agents that have knowledge and reasoning that allow them to be aware of the local context and share that knowledge withe other devices within the system.
- Context is defined to by information about location, environmental attributes, the people, devices, and objects that it contains.
- Ontologies are key for develpoing context-aware systems
